### How to play
FreeCell is a solitaire card game played using the standard 52-card deck.
Cards are dealt face-up into eight cascades.
Any cell card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.
The top card of each cascade begins a tableau.
Tableaux must be built down by alternating colors.
Foundations are built up by suit.

The game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.
